Ok so definitely need an authenticator to efficiently get channel emotes.



Other things I can do
- Have opacity decrease after set time.
- Need to add a check if image is loading / if just sent a single emote needs to be larger.
- Also needs some sort of badge support, ability to change color of bots.
